# Udemy-webscrapping

On this project, I study web scrapping.

The project has the following structure: 

    └── src
        └──guides
        └──practice
            └──single_page
            └──multiple_page
        └── scripts
            └── basics
            └── bs4_and_requests
            └── scrapy_examples

## description:

- 4: extract response from URL
- 5: get back to step 2 with more URLs
