On this project, I study web scrapping.

The project has the following structure:

        └── class
            └──practice
        └── scripts
            └── basics

- src: as main folder
    - class: for main classes to use
        - practice: scripts to pratice 
    - scripts: for class scripts
    - basics: for basic building blocks or concepts.
