# Udemy-webscrapping

On this project, I study web scrapping.

The project has the following structure: 

└── src
    └── class
    └── scripts
        └── basics
            └── oop.py
            └── program.ipynb

## description: 
- src: as main folder
- src/class: for main classes to use
- src/scripts: for specific scripts 
- src/scripts/basics: for basic building blocks or concepts.

## steps

- 1: define a URL seed
- 2: do a request to URL
- 3: get response from URL 
- 4: extract response from URL
- 5: get back to step 2 with more URLs
