            └──practice
                └──single_page
                └──multiple_page
        └── scripts
            └── basics

## description: 
- src: as main folder
    - class: for main classes to use
        - practice: scripts to pratice

            - multiple_page: practice scripts for horizontal and vertical scrapy
